# The 2–3–1 Method: How CAIO Produces Boardroom-Ready Briefs

Have you ever sat in boardrooms where the meetings are endless, the discussion cycles go on and on and yet no end seems to be in sight? The worst part is, when you think we have reached a conclusion at the meeting, the conclusion more often than naught, turns out to be, "Let's circle back to this issue in the NEXT MEETING"

Oh the dread ... especially when your brain sings - "Hello darkness, my old friend ..."

Of course, I have been on the other end of such meetings. And as any white collar employee, I have to say, not really all that productive. Which is why this became an important point for me while developing CAIO - Quick, actionable results that can be executed. 

So, that begs the question - How does CAIO do it? And what is the "2-3-1 Method"? Here's your answer!

When you upload a document to **CAIO**, five CXO brains (CFO, COO, CHRO, CMO, CPO) read the same file. To keep outputs crisp and usable, we enforce a simple format:

- **2–3 highlights** per brain (risks, opportunities, signals)
- **1 recommendation** per brain (the best next action)

This is the **2–3–1 Method**.

## Why 2–3–1?

- **Signal over noise.** You shouldn’t scroll through walls of text in a meeting.
- **Cross-functional clarity.** You see the same doc through five lenses—finance, operations, people, marketing, product.
- **Action first.** Every section ends with one concrete recommendation.

## What it looks like

**CFO**
- Highlight: Unit economics improve 6–8% if discounts are trimmed by 2%.
- Highlight: Cash runway is sensitive to DSO; collections need focus.
- **Recommendation:** Move key accounts to net-30 with early-pay incentive.

**COO**
- Highlight: SLA breaches happen in onboarding week 1.
- Highlight: Cycle time peaks during quarter-end spikes.
- **Recommendation:** Stage work in 2 queues and pre-load week-1 checklists.

…and so on for CHRO, CMO, and CPO. CAIO then surfaces **collective insights** (themes that recur across brains) so leadership can align.

## Where this helps most

- Quarterly and board reviews  
- Customer proposals & SOWs  
- Budget approvals & hiring plans  
- Launch & GTM packs
