# From Document to Decision: A Quick Walkthrough

Excel files ... Our bread and butter, our modern weapons of success and at the sae time, our true test of patience! What hasn't been felt about Excel files! This whole blog can be one Excel file and my feelings might run out before it does! Something that can be so confusing, with built-in formulae, the ability to be transferred, shared, and even worked upon in a cloud capacity, has managed to give so many people nightmares!!

So, how does CAIO help here? Let me explain - 

Say you upload **Q3 Sales Pipeline.xlsx**. Here’s what happens.

## 1) Upload

Drag-and-drop or click upload. CAIO reads the sheet and infers fields like owner, stage, region, ACV, and days-in-stage.

> Tip: messy columns are okay — we normalize common headers automatically.

## 2) Analyze (five CXO brains)

**CFO**  
- Highlight: Weighted pipeline coverage is **2.3×** vs target (enterprise skew).  
- Highlight: 40% of late-stage deals have **>10%** discretionary discount.  
- **Recommendation:** Cap discretionary discount at 7% in Q4; CFO review above that.

**COO**  
- Highlight: Lead→opportunity conversion dips in **APAC** by 18%.  
- Highlight: Deal cycle length correlates with late legal redlines.  
- **Recommendation:** Standardize MSA addenda; pre-approve regional clauses.

**CHRO**  
- Highlight: Two pods >130% capacity; reps miss coaching hours.  
- **Recommendation:** Rebalance pods and reinstate weekly coaching for bottom quartile.

**CMO**  
- Highlight: Handoff times spike after gated eBook campaigns.  
- **Recommendation:** Shift to ungated pillar pages + retargeting for high intent.

**CPO**  
- Highlight: POC friction from data-export constraints.  
- **Recommendation:** Ship “Export Lite” this patch; unblock 6 deals.

## 3) Act (the one-pager)

CAIO merges duplicates across brains and surfaces **collective insights** (e.g., discount policy affects CFO *and* CMO goals). You get a one-pager with next steps, owners, and timelines — ready for the meeting.

### Example action table

| Action | Owner | When | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cap discretionary discount at 7% | CFO | This week | Win-rate impact |
| Pre-approve APAC clauses | COO/Legal | 2 weeks | Edge cases |
| Reinstate coaching | CHRO | This week | Manager bandwidth |
| Ship Export Lite | CPO | Next patch | Scope creep |
